This set of macros runs the EMCal pi0 calibration which is ran over a user defined set of DSTs/runs and produces a C DBTTREE which is the calibration.

doFitAndCalibUpdate.C
This does the fitting of the pi0 peak, compares it to the target mass and generates a new calibration with which will obtain target mass with subsiquant runnings over the data.

Base directory
This contains the area where the condor jobs are submitted and the multi-step proceedure is executed via run.sh.
To exicute the proceedure do sh run.sh
run.sh contains the logic of how the calibration proceeds. 

Fun4All_EMCal.C
This is the main histogram-making Fun4All macro and is run over condor generally. It takes arguements of the path to the calibration file to use, a DST file list, number of events to process, and the iteration number (only usered for output naming purposes).
